## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack locked: alacritty_terminal 0.25.1 (exact pin), wgpu 28.0.0, glyphon 0.10.0, winit 0.30.13, tokio 1.50.0
- Windows-first: DX12 backend, ConPTY, UTF-8 code page 65001 set at startup
- Architecture: dedicated PTY reader thread (not Tokio task), lock-minimizing GridSnapshot pattern
- Phase 2 shell integration: needs research on PSReadLine 2.x PreExecution hook API before planning

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: PSReadLine 2.x `PreExecution` hook availability in Windows 11 default PowerShell 7 needs verification before implementing shell integration (medium confidence per research)
- Phase 3: `alacritty_terminal` 0.25.1 OSC handler trait interface needs verification against actual crate docs (exact trait names not confirmed)
