# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** A terminal that looks and feels normal but passively watches, indexes, and snapshots everything -- surfacing intelligence only when you need it.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Current Position

Milestone v2.2 Multi-Agent Coordination shipped 2026-03-10.
No active milestone. Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to start next.

Progress: [##########] 100% (all milestones through v2.2 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (cumulative):**
- v1.0: 12 plans in ~1.8 hours (~9 min/plan)
- v1.1: 12 plans in ~4.5 hours (~20 min/plan)
- v1.2: 13 plans in ~6 hours (~28 min/plan)
- v1.3: 11 plans in ~2 hours (~11 min/plan)
- v2.0: 12 plans in ~23 min (~4 min/plan)
- v2.1: 11 plans in ~23 min (~3 min/plan)
- v2.2: 8 plans in ~30 min (~4 min/plan)
- Total: 79 plans across 34 phases in 6 days

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

### Pending Todos

1 pending (Mouse drag-and-select for copy paste).

### Blockers/Concerns

- macOS code signing deferred -- unsigned DMG triggers Gatekeeper
- Windows code signing deferred -- SmartScreen warnings
- pruner.rs max_size_mb not enforced (minor, count/age pruning sufficient)
- ScaleFactorChanged is log-only (no dynamic font metric recalculation)
- Package manager manifests have placeholder values needing replacement at publish time
- Tab-to-agent PID mapping may be infeasible cross-platform (process tree walking)
